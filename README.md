# Univariate Regression

In this series of notebooks, I am exploring machine learning algorithms by implementing them from scratch in Python. This is inspired by Andrew Ng's machine learning class. The training datasets also belong to [that course](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning)

We first start by looking at linear regression with one variable.
