Simple linear regression with one variable 

In this series of notebooks, I am exploring machine learning algorithms by implemengting them from scratch in Python. This is inspired from Andrew Ng's machine leanring course. The training datasets also belong to [that course](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning)

We first start by exploring linear regression with one variable.
